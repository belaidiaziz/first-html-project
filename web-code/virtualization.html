  <h1>Virtualization</h1>
<p>In comtputing,<b> Virtualization</b>
  refers to the act of creating a
  virtual italic <em>(rather than actud)</em>
  vertion of someting <br> this includes virtual computer
hadwer,vittual storag devis and vitual network resources. </p>
<hr>
  <h1> level of Virtualization</h1>
  <ol>
  <h5> <li>virtualization at Instruction Set architecture (ISA)level </li> </h5>
      <p>Envery machine has an instruction set. This instuction set is an interface betwen softwere and hardwere. Using this instuction softwere can<br>
        communicate with hadwere.
      </p>
  <h5>  <li>virtualization at Opiratiin System (O.S.)level</li> </h5>
<p>
  In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e by installing O.S, applications
  suites, networking systems.etc.
<ul>
<li>In clod somtimes, we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, if we use virtulization at hardwere abstraction layer <br>
  (HAL) level this can take too much time.
  <li> So, To overcome this in Virtulization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along whith the <br>
    hardwere.
</ul>
